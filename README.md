## Background
SharePoint farms have many servers with various services, applications, traffic patterns, and purposes. Having "grid" scripts like the below sample screen-shots can save lots of time. What's a "grid"? Simple. I wanted to build a real-time Excel spreadsheet to display ALL configuration without RDP. RDP won't scale. While great for 1-2 servers, it's awful for 10+ servers. Having confidence in your configs and knowing everything is 100% consistent are BIG steps forward for most admins.
